## What to bring?

### Hardware
Do bring your laptop and any accessories that you need for it. We should have enough plug sockets, but chargers, cables and any such accessories will be your responsibility. Our friends from MLH will provide a hardware lab with things you will be able to hack on — Raspberry Pis, Amazon Echo speakers, VR headsets and so on.

### Sleeping
Although sleeping is not wildly popular amongst hackers, we encourage taking at least a short nap. There will be a sleeping area with airbeds but for your own comfort we recommend bringing a sleeping bag or a blanket.

### Hygiene
To make sure you and your fellow hackers feel great hacking together, it is important to take care of yourself. Thus, we kindly ask you to bring these itemps with you:

- Tooth brush & toothpaste
- Deodorant
- A change of clothes

Unfortunately there will be no showers available. Feminine hygiene products will be provided, however, feel free to bring your own.

## Social media
